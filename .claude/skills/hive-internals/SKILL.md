description: Mechanism, measurements, and incident history behind hive's rule-file prohibitions - tmux panes and typing, the store and data dir, worker state and hooks, the native addon and interpreter pin, the tool contract (lifecycle matrix, naming, CLI/MCP split), and project scoping. Consult before touching src/tmux.ts, src/spawn.ts, src/scheduler.ts, src/tools/*.ts, src/cli.ts, src/db.ts, src/dataDir.ts, src/backup.ts, src/abi.ts, src/context.ts, or src/hook.ts, and whenever a rule file's short prohibition needs the "why" behind it.

# hive-internals

Six rule files in `.claude/rules/` state prohibitions only - short, imperative, enforced by code. The reasoning behind each one - the incident that produced it, the measurement that pins the number, the mechanism that explains why the alternative doesn't work - lives here instead, so it costs nothing until something actually needs it.

Each reference file mirrors one rule file's original content, unabridged, in the order the rule file used to present it. Read the rule file first for the prohibition; come here for why it exists.

## References

- `references/tmux-and-panes.md` - tmux panes and typing into them: the private-server-vs-default-store refusal, why `tmux_target` is always a pane id, the dialog and unsubmitted-text holds, the five paths that can type into a pane, why a tmux timeout is a third outcome, `execFileSync` argument arrays, iTerm's minimal PATH. The largest reference here by far.
- `references/store-and-datadir.md` - the store and the data dir: why the data dir is read at call time, the 2026-07-28 incident that made test isolation enforced rather than conventional, append-only migrations, the write-lock rules, and what a live restore does to open connections.
- `references/worker-state.md` - worker state and hooks: why `agent_state_log` is append-only, five incidents where worker state was wrong and how each was closed, why a spawned or resumed worker's first idle is not a finish, and why wake bodies are delivered verbatim.
- `references/native-addon.md` - the native addon and the interpreter pin: why hive pins an absolute interpreter, the Node-API floor and why it's checked per release line, what a plain `npm install` does and doesn't fix, and the SessionStart hook as the one entry point the pin doesn't cover.
- `references/tool-contract.md` - the tool contract: the verified lifecycle matrix, the naming convention for a new tool's verb, why write tools return slim receipts, the unknown-key strictness mechanism, and the CLI/MCP split.
- `references/project-scoping.md` - project scoping: why a worker's files and its store are separate questions, the mechanics of a cross-project spawn, and the accepted residuals in that design.

## Using this

Search by topic across all six with `grep -rn "<term>" .claude/skills/hive-internals/references/`, or open the one file that matches the rule you're extending. This is reference material, not a todo list - nothing here needs promoting elsewhere.
